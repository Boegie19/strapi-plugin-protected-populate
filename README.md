## 🚦 Current Status

This package is currently under development and should be consider **ALPHA** in terms of state. I/We are currently accepting contributions.

For more information on contributing please see [the contrib message below](#contributing).


## ✨ Features

These are the primary features that are finished or currently being worked on:

- [x] Protected your Get request populates and fields
- [ ] Allow you to protect routes per role (In the near future)

## 🤔 Motivation

The purpose of this plugin is to have a easy way to protect your get endpoints from getting to much information out of them.
I made this plugin since I got sick and tired of writing complex policies to do this exact thing.
